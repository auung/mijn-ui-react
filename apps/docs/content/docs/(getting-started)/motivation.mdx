title: Motivation
description: We have always been impressed by how ShadCN UI components can be both beautiful and functional. However, when we needed to integrate ShadCN into our projects, we encountered several challenges that led us to develop our own solution.

### Limitations of ShadCN UI

- **Limited Variant Options**: ShadCN UI offers a limited number of variant options, which can restrict design flexibility.
- **Styled/Unstyled Options**: For unstyled variants, ShadCN UI relies on Radix components, which can be cumbersome, especially for complex components like dialogs. This often necessitates rewriting components or dealing with messy class overrides.
- **Missing Components**: ShadCN UI lacks certain components such as full calendars, multi-selects, and input fields with icons.

### Why We Created Mijn-UI

To address these challenges, we developed Mijn-UI with the following features:

- **Both Styled and Unstyled**: Components come with both styled and unstyled variants, providing developers with more design freedom.
- **Extensive Variant Options**: A wider range of variant options to easily fit into any design system.
- **Additional Components**: Includes components like calendars, multi-selects, and input fields with icons to enhance functionality.
- **Easy Integration**: Packaged as an npm module for easy installation and maintenance, ensuring a smooth development experience.
