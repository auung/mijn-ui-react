### Installation

<Steps>
  <Step>
  **Install Next.js and Required Dependencies**

  ```bash title="bash"
  npx create-next-app@latest
  ```

  Make sure to use Tailwind CSS when setting up your Next.js project.

  ```bash title="bash"
    ...
    ✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
    ✔ Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
    ✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? Yes # [!code highlight]
    ✔ Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? No / Yes
    ✔ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
    ✔ Would you like to use Turbopack for next dev? No / Yes
    ✔ Would you like to customize the import alias (@/* by default)? No / Yes
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
  **Install Tailwind Theme Plugin**

  MijnUI provides a Tailwind plugin with a default theme. You can use this default theme or [override](/docs/theming#overriding-colors) it as needed. Currently, we have only one theme available.

  ```package-install
  @mijn-ui/react-theme
  ```
  
  In the Tailwind config file:

  ```tsx title="tailwind.config.js"
    import { mijnUiPreset } from "@mijn-ui/react-theme"
    /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */

    export default {
      content: [
        ...
        "./node_modules/@mijn-ui/**/dist/*.js", // Ensure Tailwind scans all mijn-ui packages  // [!code highlight]
      ],
      presets: [mijnUiPreset], // [!code highlight]
    }
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
  **That's it**

  You can now start adding components to your project. Check out the [components](/docs/components/accordion) section to learn more about the available components.
