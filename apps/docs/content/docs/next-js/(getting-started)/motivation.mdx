title: Motivation
description: We have always been impressed by the fact that ShadCN UI components can be really beautiful and functional at the same time. When we needed to integrate ShadCN into our projects, we faced several challenges that made us implement our solution.

### Limitations of ShadCN UI

- **Limited Variant Options**: ShadCN UI doesn't have a lot of variant options, which could limit design flexibility.
- **Styled/Unstyled Options**: For unstyled variants, ShadCN/UI would have to use the Radix components, which is a pain and especially for more complex components like dialogs. Many times this requires a rewrite of components or dealing with really messy class overrides.
- **Missing Components**: ShadCN/UI doesn't contain full calendars, multi-selects, and icon-ready input fields.

### Why We Created Mijn-UI

In view of these challenges, we created Mijn-UI to handle the following:

- **Both Styled and Unstyled**: To have the components come with both styled and unstyled variants to give more freedom to developers with their own designs.

- **Extensive Variant Options**: More variant options to fit into any design system with ease.

- **Additional Components**: Include components like calendars, multi-selects, and icon-ready input fields to enhance the library's functionality.

- **Easy Integration**: Package Mijn-UI as an npm module for easy installation and maintenance, ensuring a streamlined development experience.
